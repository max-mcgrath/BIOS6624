## Introduction

We received data of 11,627 observations from 4,434 individuals with up to 
three observations per individual. Each observation tracks patients'
cardiovascular outcomes including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, cerobrovascular disease, and, most relevant to this study,
whether the patient has had a stroke since the last observation and, if so, the
timing of that stroke. Each observation also includes measured cardiovascular 
risk factors such as blood pressure, health behaviors, and medication use.

The goal of this study will be to use this data to identify clinically 
significant risk factors that are associated with higher risk of stroke 10 years
after the start of observation. The study will be stratified by sex, meaning
males and females will be treated as two separate populations with potentially
differing risk factors.
