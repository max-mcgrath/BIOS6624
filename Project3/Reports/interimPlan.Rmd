## Introduction

We received data of 11,627 observations from 4,434 individuals with up to 
three observations per individual. Each observation tracks subjects'
cardiovascular outcomes including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, cerobrovascular disease, and, most relevant to this study,
whether the subject has had a stroke since the last observation and, if so, the
timing of that stroke. Each observation also includes measured cardiovascular 
risk factors such as blood pressure, health behaviors, and medication use.

The goal of this study will be to use this data to identify clinically 
significant risk factors that are associated with higher risk of stroke 10 years
after the start of observation. The study will be stratified by sex, meaning
males and females will be treated as two separate populations with potentially
differing risk factors.

## Data cleaning

First, 32 subjects who have had a stroke prior to the start of observation were 
removed from the data set. Next, for each subject, a record of whether they
had a stroke in the first 10 years of observation was created along with the
timing of that stroke (which we will refer to as event time). If they did not 
have an event in those years, they were classified as right censored. For the
analysis, there are 2472 subjects with sex listed as female with with 229 who
had an event and 2243 who are censored, and there are 1930 with sex listed as
male with 261 who had an event and 1669 who are censored.
