## Introduction

We received data of 11,627 observations from 4,434 individuals with up to 
three observations per individual. Each observation tracks subjects'
cardiovascular outcomes including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, cerobrovascular disease, and, most relevant to this study,
whether the subject has had a stroke since the last observation and, if so, the
timing of that stroke. Each observation also includes measured cardiovascular 
risk factors such as blood pressure, health behaviors, and medication use.

The goal of this study will be to use this data to identify clinically 
significant risk factors that are associated with higher risk of stroke 10 years
after the start of observation. The study will be stratified by sex, meaning
males and females will be treated as two separate populations with potentially
differing risk factors.

## Data Preperation and Analysis

First, 32 subjects who have had a stroke prior to the start of observation were 
removed from the data set. Next, for each subject, a record of whether they
had a stroke in the first 10 years of observation was created along with the
timing of that stroke (which we will refer to as event time). If they did not 
have an event in those years, they were classified as right censored. Based on 
the findings of Wolf (1990) as well as data availability, age, systolic
blood pressure (SBP), antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette 
smoking,  and cardiovascular disease will be included in the analysis
as potential risk factors (all measured at baseline). Age and SBP will be 
treated as continuous variables with the rest treated as dichotomous. 60 
observations which had missing values for at least one of the potential risk
factors were also removed.

After preparing the data, there are 2434 subjects with sex listed as female
including 221 who had an event and 2213 who are censored, and there are 1908 
subjects with sex listed as male with 256 who had an event and 1652 who are 
censored.

The first part of the analysis will provide summaries of both outcomes and 
potential risk factors stratified by sex. Next, estimated Kaplan-Meier survival
curves will be fit to crudely estimate event probability after beginning 
observation. Then, to fully quantify each risk factors impact on stroke 
occurrence, a Cox proportional hazards
regression will be fit for each sex with the number of days after beginning 
observation that a stroke occurred and the last observation time in days as the 
outcome and the potential risk factors described above as variables of interest.
Log-rank tests will then be used to evaluate the significance of each 
potential risk factor, and coefficient estimates will be used to quantify
the relationship between potential risk factors and stroke occurrence. 

Lastly, we will provide summary statistics of the changes in potential risk 
factors from the first observation to the last and discuss the potential
impact of using a more complex, time-varying covariate analysis rather than
simply evaluating relationships between baseline values and stroke occurence.
