## Introduction

We received data of 11,627 observations from 4,434 individuals with up to 
three observations per individual. Each observation tracks subjects'
cardiovascular outcomes including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, 
heart failure, cerobrovascular disease, and, most relevant to this study,
whether the subject has had a stroke since the last observation and, if so, the
timing of that stroke. Each observation also includes measured cardiovascular 
risk factors such as blood pressure, health behaviors, and medication use.

The goal of this study will be to use this data to identify clinically 
significant risk factors that are associated with higher risk of stroke 10 years
after the start of observation. The study will be stratified by sex, meaning
males and females will be treated as two separate populations with potentially
differing risk factors.

## Data Preperation and Analysis

First, 32 subjects who have had a stroke prior to the start of observation were 
removed from the data set. Next, for each subject, a record of whether they
had a stroke in the first 10 years of observation was created along with the
timing of that stroke (which we will refer to as event time). If they did not 
have an event in those years, they were classified as right censored. Based on 
the findings of Wolf (1990) as well as data availability, age, systolic
blood pressure (SBP), antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette 
smoking,  and cardiovascular disease will be included in the analysis
as potential risk factors (all measured at baseline). Age and SBP will be 
treated as continuous variables with the rest treated as dichotomous. 60 
observations which had missing values for at least one of the potential risk
factors were also removed.

After preparing the data, there are 2434 subjects with sex listed as female with
including 221 who had an event and 2213 who are censored, and there are 1908 
with sex listed as male with 256 who had an event and 1652 who are censored.
