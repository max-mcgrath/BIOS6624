## Introduction

This analysis evaluates the efficacy of a novel, take-home collection device
used to measure salivary cortisol and DHEA levels throughout the day. The
device was provided to 31 healthy control subjects who were asked to collect
saliva samples immediately upon waking, 30 minutes after waking, before lunch,
and 600 minutes after waking. The time of waking and the time before lunch were
left to the discretion of each subject. Each subject was asked to collect 
four samples per day for three days, providing a maximum of 12 samples per
subject. 

The samples were collected using a filter
paper device termed the Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT)
booklet which was kept in a bottle with an electronic monitoring cap. Subjects
were asked to manually record the time the sample was taken, and the electronic
monitoring cap also recorded the timing of the sample. From each sample,
cortisol and DHEA levels were measured in nanomoles per liter. 

This analysis has three aims: (1) evaluate the agreement between the subject's
recordings of sampling times and those recorded by the electronic monitoring 
cap, (2) evaluate subject adherence to specified sample timing, and (3) quantify
changes of cortisol and DHEA over time.

## Methods

### Data Preperation

### Analysis

Knowing the data consists of repeated observations from each subject, it is 
foreseeable that intrasubject DHEA and cortisol levels will be correlated. So,
to quantify changes in DHEA and cortisol over time, two linear mixed-effects 
models (one for each hormone) were fit with the intercept allowed to vary by 
subject, thereby accounting for this correlation. Further, given
the known diurnal trend in which DHEA and cortisol peak 30 minutes after waking,
the fixed components of the linear models were segmented into piecewise
components wherein the linear trends were allowed to differ before and after
30 minutes after waking. For each model, time after waking was used as the sole
predictor, and the natural log of the measurement of DHEA and cortisol levels 
were used as responses for each hormone's respective model.
