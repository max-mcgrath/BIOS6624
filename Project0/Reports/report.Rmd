## Introduction

This analysis evaluates the efficacy of a novel, take-home collection device
used to measure salivary cortisol and DHEA levels throughout the day, and
examines DHEA and cortisol level time trends. The
device was provided to 31 healthy control subjects who were asked to collect
saliva samples immediately upon waking, 30 minutes after waking, before lunch,
and 600 minutes after waking. The time of waking and the time before lunch were
left to the discretion of each subject. Each subject was asked to collect 
four samples per day for three days, providing a maximum of 12 samples per
subject. 

The samples were collected using a filter
paper device termed the Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT)
booklet which was kept in a bottle with an electronic monitoring cap (MEM). 
Subjects
were asked to manually record the time the sample was taken, and the electronic
monitoring cap also recorded the timing of the sample. From each sample,
cortisol and DHEA levels were measured in nanomoles per liter. 

This analysis has three aims: (1) evaluate agreement between the subject's
recordings of sampling times and those recorded by the MEM, (2) evaluate subject
adherence to specified sample timing, and (3) quantify
changes of cortisol and DHEA over time.

As such, we will test three hypotheses: (1) Subject's booklet recordings and the
times recorded by the MEM are significantly correlated, (2) ..., and (3) DHEA
and cortisol levels are positively correlated with time until 30 minutes after
waking and then negatively correlated with time for the remainder of the day.

## Methods

### Data Preperation

### Analysis

To evaluate agreement between the subjects' booklet recordings of sampling 
times and those recorded by the MEM, a linear model was fit with MEM time as the
response variable and booklet time as the predictor. Raw times were used for 
this section, as minutes since waking (which is used for the other sections
of this analysis), yielded a fit with obviously correlated residuals. The
slope estimate of this model was then examined to quantify correlation between
the examined times, and a t-test was conducted to evaluate the estimates
statistical significance. A plot comparing booklet times and MEM times is also
provided.

Aim 2: ...

Knowing the data consists of repeated observations from each subject, it is 
foreseeable that intrasubject DHEA and cortisol levels are correlated. So,
to quantify changes in DHEA and cortisol over time, two linear mixed-effects 
models (one for each hormone) were fit with intercepts allowed to vary by 
subject, thereby accounting for this correlation. Further, given
the known diurnal trend in which DHEA and cortisol levels peak 30 minutes after 
waking and then taper throughout the day,
the fixed effects of the linear models were segmented into piecewise
components wherein the linear trends were allowed to differ before and after
30 minutes after waking. For each model, time after waking was used as the sole
predictor, and the natural log of the measurement of DHEA and cortisol levels 
were used as responses for each hormone's respective model.

## Results

The linear model used to test the hypothesis that subject's booklet recordings 
and the times recorded by the MEM are significantly correlated had an estimated 
slope coefficient of 0.9938 with a p-value less than .001. A plot of the MEM
recorded times versus the subject recorded times is included in the appendix
in Figure ???.



## Conclusions

## Reproducible research information

The code used to generate this analysis is available on GitHub 
at https://github.com/BIOS6624-UCD/bios6624-MaxMcGrath/tree/main/Project0
. The `Background` folder contains information pertinent to understanding the
analysis but unnecessary for reproducing it. The `Code` folder contains five
files: `1-DataPrep.R`, `2-EDA.R`, `3-Analysis-Aim1.R`, `4-Analysis-Aim2.R`, and
`5-Analysis-Aim3.R`. These R scripts are dependent upon a data file 
`Data/Project0_Clean_v2.csv` which is not available on GitHub, but may be requested
by emailing `max.mcgrath@ucdenver.edu`. To run the complete analysis, each
script should be run in the order of the number preceding its filename. The
last directory, `Report`, contains the RMarkdown file `report.Rmd` which may
be used to generate this report (note that it also depends on the aforementioned
data).

This analysis was performed using R version 4.0.4. The following non-base R 
packages were used: lme4 (1.1.26), dplyr (1.0.5), ggplot2 (3.3.3),
stringr (1.4.0), hms (1.0.0), car (3.0-10), and tidyverse (1.3.0).
