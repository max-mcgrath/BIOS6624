## Introduction

This analysis evaluates the efficacy of a novel, take-home collection device
used to measure salivary cortisol and DHEA levels throughout the day. The
device was provided to 31 healthy control subjects who were asked to collect
saliva samples immediately upon waking, 30 minutes after waking, before lunch,
and 600 minutes after waking. The time of waking and the time before lunch were
left to the discretion of each subject. Each subject was asked to collect 
four samples per day for three days, providing a maximum of 12 samples per
subject. 

The samples were collected using a filter
paper device termed the Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT)
booklet which was kept in a bottle with an electronic monitoring cap (MEM). 
Subjects
were asked to manually record the time the sample was taken, and the electronic
monitoring cap also recorded the timing of the sample. From each sample,
cortisol and DHEA levels were measured in nanomoles per liter. 

This analysis has three aims: (1) evaluate agreement between the subject's
recordings of sampling times and those recorded by the MEM, (2) evaluate subject
adherence to specified sample timing, and (3) quantify
changes of cortisol and DHEA over time.

## Methods

### Data Preperation

### Analysis

To evaluate agreement between the subjects' booklet recordings of sampling 
times and those recorded by the MEM, a linear model was fit with MEM time as the
response variable and booklet time as the predictor. Raw times were used for 
this section, as minutes since waking (which is used for the other sections
of this analysis), yielded a fit with obviously correlated residuals. The
slope estimate of this model was then examined to quantify correlation between
the examined times, and a t-test was conducted to evaluate the estimates
statistical significance. A plot comparing booklet times and MEM times is also
provided.

Aim 2: ...

Knowing the data consists of repeated observations from each subject, it is 
foreseeable that intrasubject DHEA and cortisol levels are correlated. So,
to quantify changes in DHEA and cortisol over time, two linear mixed-effects 
models (one for each hormone) were fit with intercepts allowed to vary by 
subject, thereby accounting for this correlation. Further, given
the known diurnal trend in which DHEA and cortisol peak 30 minutes after waking,
the fixed effects of the linear models were segmented into piecewise
components wherein the linear trends were allowed to differ before and after
30 minutes after waking. For each model, time after waking was used as the sole
predictor, and the natural log of the measurement of DHEA and cortisol levels 
were used as responses for each hormone's respective model.

## Conclusions

## Reproducible research information

This analysis was performed using R version 4.0.4. The following non-base R 
packages were used: lme4 (1.1.26), dplyr (1.0.5), ggplot2 (3.3.3),
stringr (1.4.0), hms (1.0.0), car (3.0-10), and tidyverse (1.3.0).
