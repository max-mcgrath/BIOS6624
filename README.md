# Bios6624Class

**PI:**Nichole Carlson  
**Analyst**:Nichole Carlson  

This is the example repository for the project work for Bios6624. In this course we will complete 5 projects (0-4). Each project is contained in a single subfolder. Each of these subfolders have the same folder structure described below.  Not, in the .gitignore file the DataRaw and DataProcessed folders are ignored. So they will exist with the analyst, but not on Github. This prevents data sharing prior to final release with publication.

Details about the folder structure for a project:

File | Description
---|---------------------------------------------------------------------
Background | contains the background information for the analysis
Code | contains all R scripts for this project
DataRaw | contain all raw data provided by investigators
DataProcessed | contains the processed data used for analysis
Reports | contains all output, rmarkdown files and report
